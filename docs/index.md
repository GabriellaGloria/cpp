# Hello, world!
Hi, all! I am gabriella currently Y3 NUS CS 🫡. <br>
This site consist of cpp notes from books, blogs, and cppcons that I found.<br>
My notes are for my personal use to remind me of C++ tricks and prepare for interviews ✌️.<br>
It is still in progress but I will try to write as much as I learn!<br>
